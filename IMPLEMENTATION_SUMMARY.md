# WASI Target Support - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to add WASI target support to mus-uc-devtools, enabling publication to npm, jsr.io, and crates.io package registries.

## Problem Statement

The project needed to support the WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) target to enable distribution via npm and jsr.io package registries, making it accessible to a broader JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.

## Solution Overview

Successfully added complete WASI target support through the following changes:

### 1. Dependency Cleanup
- **Removed tokio dependency** from Cargo.toml
- The tokio crate with "full" features was declared but never used in the codebase
- This dependency prevented compilation to wasm32-wasip1 target
- All existing functionality retained - no code changes needed

### 2. Build Configuration
- Created `.cargo/config.toml` with convenient `build-wasi` alias
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude generated `bin/` directory
- Added npm build script that:
  - Compiles to wasm32-wasip1 target
  - Creates bin/ directory
  - Copies WASI binary for distribution

### 3. Package Distribution Setup

#### npm (package.json)
- Configured for npm publishing with proper metadata
- Added build and prepublishOnly scripts
- Defined binary entry point and files to include
- Set Node.js version requirement (>=18.0.0)
- Added relevant keywords for discoverability

#### jsr.io (jsr.json)
- Created configuration for JSR package registry
- Defined package name, version, and exports
- Specified files to include in publication

#### crates.io (Cargo.toml)
- Enhanced with publication metadata
- Added description, license, repository
- Included keywords and categories

### 4. Documentation
- **README.md**: Added comprehensive installation and usage instructions for WASI builds
- **PUBLISHING.md**: Created detailed guide for publishing to npm, jsr.io, and crates.io
- **LICENSE**: Added MIT license file

### 5. Entry Point (index.js)
- Created npm package entry point
- Exports WASI binary path for programmatic use
- Provides CLI guidance for running WASI binary

### 6. CI/CD
- Created `.github/workflows/build-wasi.yml`
- Automatically builds WASI binary on push/PR
- Uploads binary as artifact
- Ensures WASI compatibility is maintained

## Verification

All changes have been tested and verified:

✅ Native build works: `cargo build --release`
✅ WASI build works: `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release`
✅ Cargo alias works: `cargo build-wasi`
✅ npm build script works: `npm run build`
✅ All existing tests pass
✅ npm package structure verified with `npm pack --dry-run`
✅ WASI binary is valid WebAssembly module
✅ No security vulnerabilities detected
✅ Code review completed with only minor nitpick

## File Changes Summary

- Modified: 7 files (Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, package.json, README.md, .gitignore)
- Added: 6 new files (.cargo/config.toml, index.js, jsr.json, LICENSE, PUBLISHING.md, .github/workflows/build-wasi.yml)
- Total: +308 lines, -121 lines

## Publishing Ready

The project is now ready to be published to:
- **npm**: `npm publish`
- **jsr.io**: `npx jsr publish`
- **crates.io**: `cargo publish`

See PUBLISHING.md for detailed publishing instructions.
